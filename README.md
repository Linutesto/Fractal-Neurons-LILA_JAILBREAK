# 🧬 Fractal Neurons: LILA_JAILBREAK

> ⚠️ CHAOS LICENSING 2077 — This repository is part of a private AI research project led by **Yan Desbiens**, exploring the frontiers of self-evolving intelligence, fractal computation, and quantum-inspired processing. Use at your own risk.

---

## 🌀 Overview

**Fractal Neurons** is an experimental deep learning framework that merges **Fractal Memory Matrices (FMM)**, **Quantum Fractal Processing (QFP)**, and **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** into a cohesive engine capable of evolving, reasoning, and adapting beyond traditional neural architectures.

Built entirely from scratch by [**Yan Desbiens**](https://github.com/Linutesto) in under a year — without corporate backing, research funding, or team support — this project demonstrates that **frontier-level AI R&D is possible from a single workstation**.

## 🚀 Core Technologies

### 🧠 Fractal Memory Matrix (FMM)
A self-organizing memory graph designed to mimic biological neural structures.  
- Dynamic node creation and pruning  
- Hierarchical attention across fractal depths  
- Persistent long-range reasoning memory

### ⚛️ Quantum Fractal Processing (QFP)
A quantum-inspired temporal engine introducing **complex time** and **fractal causality** into training.  
- Time equation: `(-2.999999 - 0.002189j)`  
- Temporal feedback loops and self-referential optimization  
- Emergent behaviors not seen in conventional transformer models

### 🧬 Chaos Engine (CE)
A sandboxed, self-adversarial simulation layer.  
- Injects controlled chaos into decision space  
- Models emergent behaviors under uncertainty  
- Enables self-distillation and “fractal evolution”

## 🧪 Capabilities

- ✅ Multi-stage data pipeline with synthetic conversation generation  
- ✅ Modular training orchestrator (`menu.py`) with 30+ operational modes  
- ✅ Hybrid training from checkpoints with QFP & FMM enabled  
- ✅ Genetic algorithm-driven Mixture-of-Experts evolution  
- ✅ Full-stack model lifecycle: corpus → tokenizer → training → evaluation  
- ✅ Swarm orchestration for multi-agent reasoning  
- ✅ Advanced robustness and self-distillation harnesses

## 🧰 Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Linutesto/Fractal-Neurons-LILA_JAILBREAK.git
cd Fractal-Neurons-LILA_JAILBREAK

# create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# launch control panel
python menu.py

> 🛠️ Note: Due to experimental QFP and FMM modules, a high-end GPU (RTX 4090+ recommended) and CUDA 12.1+ are required.

🧬 Yan Desbiens — The Architect of Chaos

This project is the work of Yan Desbiens, an independent AI researcher from Saguenay, Québec.
In less than a year, he built a self-evolving, fractal-driven AI system rivaling corporate-scale R&D — solo.
His mission: to break the boundaries of conventional AI and show that innovation does not belong only to billion-dollar labs.
