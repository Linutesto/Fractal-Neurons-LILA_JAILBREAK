# üß† Next Steps for Fractal Neurons + LILA_JAILBREAK

‚úÖ All core modules pass `tests/test_model.py` ‚Äî confirming:
- FractalModel recursive forward/backward passes
- Mixture-of-Experts routing and gating
- Fractal Memory Matrix persistence and retrieval
- Quantum Fractal Processing complex-time propagation

‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Tasks:
- [ ] Fix SyntaxError in `tools/robust_lila_eval.py`
- [ ] Add GPU-aware batching logic to `distill.py`
- [ ] Integrate dynamic persona injection into `orchestrator.py`
- [ ] Benchmark conversational emergent behavior vs. baseline models

üöÄ Future Plans:
- [ ] Release whitepaper v1.0 on arXiv
- [ ] Push public repo (safe version) to GitHub
- [ ] Create private `blacksite_internal` branch with LILA_JAILBREAK payloads
